We want to offer a lifeline to as many of these wonderful pups as possible.  Sadly, nearly all of the dogs that City Dogs Rescue takes in are just days and sometimes hours away from being euthanized, for no reason other than lack of space.  By finding these dogs permanent and loving homes in the DC metropolitan area, we can enrich lives - both human and canine.   ",
