  "description": "<div class=\"rgDescription\">Meet Beverly! Shirelles Pup Beverly is about 5 months old and a Lab mix but we aren't sure with what- we know who mom is but we have no way to know who dad was. Her coat is short and she has some cute white markings on her chest. She came to Labs and More with her mom and sisters after being found abandoned in a parking lot. This litter didn't get much socialization with humans early in life or exposure to the big wide world, so everything is brand new and a bit scary. Beverly is doing well with house training, is crate trained and very food motivated. She loves to cuddle with her people. Because they got a late start socializing, Beverly can be a little shy at first and would benefit from a dog sibling in her forever home to show her the way. Beverly is looking for a family that understands the time, patience, and energy needed to raise a young pup. We require all puppy adopters to provide training that includes: house training, basic training, leash training, and socialization. Additionally, this cutie is going to need proper exercise, mental stimulation, and your attention and love to grow up to be the best companion. We do not allow our dogs or puppies to sleep or live outside; they must be incorporated into your family and be made a priority in your life. In return, you will have the most loving and loyal family member you could ask for. If you think you are ready to add to your family by adopting a puppy, then fill out an adoption application on our website today! Please note that processing time for applications is currently three to four weeks. We recommend completing the application process and connecting with a adoption coach before looking for a dog or puppy you'd like to adopt. If you're already approved to adopt or if you've adopted from Labs and More before, connect with your adoption coach for next steps.    This information is as up to date and accurate as possible for the dog in its current environment. All dogs and puppies will need time and training to adjust to their new surroundings and to learn the rules of their new home. If you are interested in meeting one of our dogs, the first step is to complete the Adoption Form on our website at www.labsandmore.org and take some time to review our adoption process. Your adoption includes the spay or neuter, current vaccinations, microchip, and other services provided while in our care. The safety and health of our puppies is priority one, so we only allow approved applicants to meet and handle puppies. Please understand everything we do is for the dogs and conducted by our kind and generous volunteers. We rely solely on donations, and we do not profit from a dog's adoption. Labs and More is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that operates on donations and time dedicated to this cause by volunteers. Your adoption will save the life of future dogs in need. Labs and More makes no guarantees regarding the behavior, breed, or age of the dogs in our care. Although we strive to provide necessary medical care to dogs in our care, we cannot predict future or current medical needs whether they were symptomatic or not at the time of adoption.Thank you for looking to  Adopt a Labrador Retriever or other Mixed Breed Dog from California Labradors Retrievers and More Rescue. Please take a moment and go to www.labsandmore.org and click on Adopt to complete our online dog adoption application. If you have any questions email us at doginfo@labsandmore.org or call us at  858-273-5386. Thank you for looking to a rescue group to fulfill your dream of adding a new dog to your life!
